Verbal noun of [[seinnid]] **seinnid**. In Wb., this is consistently found with a vowel between the *n* and the *mm*, whereas in other corpora, as in the modern languages, it is written without any vowel (although it is pronounced with an epenthetic vowel between the two). While this may be an attempted by the scribe of WÃ¼rzburg to represent an epenthetic, we have nevertheless set up two entries: 1) **seinmm**, and 2) **seinimm**.
