# burbbae

This noun is attested in Wb. as nominative singular *burpe* or *burbe*. According to the orthographic practice in Wb. this would suggest, but not confirm, a broad *rb*. In later texts, this cluster is found sometimes broad, sometimes slender. We thus set up two entries, the distribution of which is unclear: 1) **burbbae**, and 2) **buirbbe**.
