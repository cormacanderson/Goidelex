Verbal noun of [[do·aithchren]] **do·aithchren**. This lemma is not extensively attested, so classification is somewhat tentative. Sometimes the nominative singular has a broad final *cc*, while in Wb it is slender, suggesting that the dative has come to be used for the nominative. The genitive singular form *taidchrecce* (Wb21a6) suggests broad *cc*, which supports this interpretation. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) an ī-stem **taidchricc**, and 2) an ā-stem **taidchrecc**.
