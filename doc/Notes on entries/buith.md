Verbal noun of [[attá]] **attá**. The is most commonly a feminine i-stem *buith* in Old Irish. In Fél. and occasionally elsewhere we find it also with a slender initial, i.e. *beith* etc., always as a feminine i-stem. A feminine ā-stem, *both*, presumably the older form, is also occasionally found. We thus set up three entries: 1) **buith**, a feminine i-stem, 2) **beith**, alo a feminine i-stem, and 3) **both**, a feminine ā-stem.
