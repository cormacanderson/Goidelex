#vbnoun
This noun is listed as a neuter o-stem in Kavanagh (2001) and although there are relatively few forms in Wb. and Sg., none of them contradict this. However, in Ml. it looks like a masculine u-stem (*innimthanud* Ml42c2) and accusative plural *imthanad* (Ml93c7) is incompatible with o-stem flexion. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) *immthánad*, a neuter o-stem, and 2) *immthánud*, a masculine u-stem.
