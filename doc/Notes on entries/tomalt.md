# tomalt
#wbnoun
#vbnoun
Verbal noun of [[do·meil]] **do·meil**. There are no early instances of the nominative singular, so we presume an ā-stem *tomalt*, although it would not be surprising, if one were unearthed, for it to be rather *tomailt*, with replacement of original nominative by dative. The modern Irish form is *tomhailt*.
