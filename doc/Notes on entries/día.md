It seems likely that the in some corpora this noun was disyllabic throughout. The spelling *dea* in Sg. (162a3) is suggestive, while the metre confirms disyllabic status for  accusative singular *dia* (Fél. Ep. 153). Many, although not most, genitive singular forms also in Wb. have a spelling that points to a disyllabic reading (e.g. *dée* Wb5c18, *dǽi* in Wb22c10). We thus set up two entries: 1) monosyllabic **día**, and 2) disyllabic **diä**.
