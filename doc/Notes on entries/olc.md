As this is originally an adjective it can be used as a substantive to mean 'evil doer' in any of the three genders. We thus set up three separate entries: 1) a masculine o-stem **olc**, 2) a neuter o-stem **olc**, and 3) a feminine ā-stem **olc**. With the meaning 'evil, wrong', we also set up a further lemma, the neuter o-stem *olc*.
