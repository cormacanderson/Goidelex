# áugtordás

The phonology of this word is quite unclear. For the initial *áu*, Thurneysen (GOI §69) assumes a diphthong, which we follow here, although the forms known to me do not have the mark of length, and a diphthong is not necessary in this instance to arrive at the later reflex [uː]. As for the cluster we write *gt*, this is the most common spelling in the glosses for *augtor* (Sg 65a17) and the current word (Wb14b2, Wb9b5). Where spellings with *ct* for these two words occur (Wb3c4, MT §65, §73) we assume the influence of the Latin orthography of *auctor* and *auctoritās*, from which they were borrowed. As to the other cluster in the word, it is always spelled *rt* in early sources, but we follow CorPH and the evidence of the later language in assuming *rd*.
