Verbal noun of [[do·fúairc]] **do·fúairc**. We assume /rg/ here, although the spelling is always *rc* in the glosses. In the nominative singular, we find *un* and in other forms generally *u* in Wb. and *a* in Ml. In this respect, this lemma shows a different range of forms to others built on the same root, such as [[esorggon]] **esorggon** or [[frithorggon]] **frithorggon**. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) **túarggun**, and 2) **túarggan**. See [[esorggon]] **esorggon**.
