#vbnoun
Verbal noun of [[fo·cren]]  **fo·cren**. As [[eipistil]] **eipistil**, this is labelled as having variation in CorPH, while Kavanagh (2001) remarks that it is "originally an ī-stem" in Kavanagh. As far as I can determine, the attested forms are all straightforwardly interpretable as having ī-stem flexion too. We assume /kʹ/ for this lemma on the basis of *cc* in other forms in DIL, although it is not impossible that it had rather /gʹ/ (cf. [[acaldam]] **acaldam**).
