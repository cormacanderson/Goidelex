# ánae
#wbnoun
The headword in both DIL and CorPH is *anae*, without the length mark, but DIL remarks that Pedersen's contention that this form comes from *ad-no-* (VGKS ii 85) would require rather *ánae*. This form is found in various corpora (Wb27b9, Ml43d18, Fél Ep. 195) and on this evidence has been assumed here.
