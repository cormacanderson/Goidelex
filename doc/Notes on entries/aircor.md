This word begins with the 'ambiguous' vowel (GOI §80), suggesting a compound with *air*-, but in that case one might expect the following consonant to be lenited. Although labelled in CorPH as a verbal noun, the associated verb is not mentioned. It is not from *ar·cuirethar* (verbal noun *airchor* with quite different semantics). We assume /rk/ for the cluster, although /rg/ is not impossible. There is insufficient evidence to determine an inflectional class.
