Verbal noun of [[fo·gella]] **fo·gella**. The most common form in Old Irish is *fugall*, although there is a form *fugell* in Wb (9c5 a prima manu) and forms continuing this, i.e. with slender *g*, are more common in the later language. We thus set up two entries: 1) **fugall**, and 2) **fuigell**. cf. [[foirgell]] **foirggell**.
