Verbal noun of [[fo·saig]] **fo·saig**. This noun is very frequent in Ml., where it is found as *fochaid*, invariably spelled with *d*, and *fochaith* can be assumed for most of the forms in Wb too, although there is one instance of genitive singular *focheda* (Wb25a12)which would be suggestive of rather /xʹ/ and a citation form *foichith*. We set up three separate entries to account for this variation: 1) **fochaid**, 2) **fochaith**, and 3) **foichid**.
