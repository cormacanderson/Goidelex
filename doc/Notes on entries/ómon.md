The headword in CorPH does not have the mark of length and it is likely that there are two separate roots here, one with long *ó* and one with short *o* (DIL). In Wb., we have nominative singular *ómon*, with the length mark, and accusative singular *omun*, without it. While the overall picture is unclear, the extant data is consistent with an o-stem *ómon*, with dative for nominative in Ml., and a u-stem *omon*. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) o-stem **ómon** and 2) u-stem **omon**.
