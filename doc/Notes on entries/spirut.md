This nominative singular of this lemma is consistently monosyllabic *spiurt* in Ml. and Tur., typically disyllabic *spirut* etc. elsewhere. In Wb., it is often irregular in the genitive singular, frequently having unsyncopated forms *spiruto* (Wb9c30) and *spirito* (Wb12d21), alongside syncopated *spirto* (e.g. Wb3d20). We set up three separate entries: 1) **spirut**, inflecting normally, 2) **spirut**, with an invariable stem, and 3) **spiurt**.
