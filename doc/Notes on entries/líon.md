In Wb., this lemma is sometimes found with *nn*, but more often with *n*. Elsewhere, only single *n* is found and we follow this here. Strangely, the Wb. forms are not in DIL. This lemma is sometimes found as masculine, sometimes as neuter, so we set up two separate entries: 1) masculine u-stem **líon**, and 2) neuter u-stem **líon**.
