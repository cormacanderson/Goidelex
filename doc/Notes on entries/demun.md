The most frequent nominative singular form in the glosses is *demun*, which is the form found in both Wb. and Ml., although *demon* is also found in Old Irish, including in Wb. (a prima manu). It usually inflects as a masculine o-stem, but in the plural sometimes has aberrant flexion, which Thurneysen describes as being like that of a neuter substantival adjective (GOI ยง280). This is probably behind Kavanagh's (2001) classification of these plural cases as having neuter io-stem flexion, but this does not fit particularly well to the range of attested forms. Better is the generalisation of Stokes (1905: 318) that it declines as an i-stem in the plural. We thus set up three separate entries: 1) an o-stem **demun**, 2) an o-stem **demon**, and 3) an i-stem **demon** that only occurs in the plural.
