Given occasional spellings with *íi* it is possible that this lemma originally had hiatus in the nominative singular, but we assume a simple long vowel here. The sources disagree on the flexion. Kavanagh (2001) classifies it as an s-stem becoming an i-stem. CorPH lists it as a velar stem, while DIL says that in the singular and dual it is frequently indeclinable. We follow DIL to set up two separate entries, 1) a velar stem **lí**, and 2) an indeclinable **lí** confined to the singular and dual.
