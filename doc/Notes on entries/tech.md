The nominative-accusative singular is sometimes found as tech and sometimes teg in Old Irish. In the genitive and dative singular and throughout the plural, the initial consonant oscillates between broad and slender t. We thus set up three separate entries: 1) **teg**, with a full paradigm, 2) **tech**, found only in the nominative-vocative-accusative singular and dual, and 3) **taig**, found only outside the nominative-vocative-accusative singular and dual.
