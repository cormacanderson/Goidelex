We find the nominative singular invariably as *méit* in Wb., but in many other Old Irish corpora, Ml. in particular, we find rather *mét*. It may be that this is orthographic, but it is quite consistent and in the modern languages we find Scottish Gaelic *meud*, and both *méid* and *méad* in Modern Irish. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) **méit**, and 2) **mét**. Similar variation is found for [[rét]] **rét** and [[sét]] **sét**.
