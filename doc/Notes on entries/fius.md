Verbal noun of [[ro·fitir]] **ro·fitir**. DIL considers this lemma to be originally neuter, later masculine. It also varies between o-stem and u-stem flexion. The forms in Ml. consistently have *fis* in the nom.sg and *fius* in the dative singular, while Wb. shows variation in the nominative singular and always fius(s) in the dative singular. There are few probative forms to determine the inflectional class and it is somewhat unclear what criteria are used in Kavanagh (2001) to assign forms to one or the other inflectional class. We have tentatively set up two entries, with unclear distribution: 1) a u-stem masculine **fius**, and 3) an o-stem neuter **fius**.
