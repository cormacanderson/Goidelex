Verbal noun of [[ad·treba]] **ad·treba**. Although both CorPH and Kavanagh (2001) give the headword here as *atrab*, the spelling *attrab* (Ml92a9) suggests rather /t/. Variants with palatal /tʹrʹ/ appear relatively early (Fél. Oct 8). For these, analogical pressure may have occurred from *átt* 'place', which although perhaps originally an ā-stem (DIL) is palatalised already early, probably on the model of the dative (cf. *ait* Ml68a13). We thus have two separate entries: 1) older **attrab**, and 2) younger **áittreb**.
