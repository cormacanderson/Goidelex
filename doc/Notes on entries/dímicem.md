# dímicem
#wbnoun
While this noun is most often spelled with *cc* in Wb., this spelling is not probative (see [[acaldam]] **acaldam**) and six instances from Ml. all have singleton *c*, supported by the modern Irish reflex, *dímhigin*, with /gʹ/ rather than /kʹ/. For this reason, we assume **dímicem** here.
