Based on [[comracc]] **comracc**, verbal noun of [[con·ric]] **con·ric**. In Old Irish, the orthography of *comracc* 'encounter' shows sometimes *cc*, sometimes *c* and forms with final /k/ and final /g/ are both found in the later language. While *cc* is also used for /g/ in the Würzburg glosses (see [[acaldam]] **acaldam**), the balance of evidence somewhat favours rather /k/ in this instance.
