Verbal noun of [[for·gella]] **for·gella**. Forms with broad *rg* occur in Ml. and Fél. and constitute the regular development (Bergin, *Ériu* iii 60 § 30). However, forms with slender *rg* are more common in the glosses. While forms with lenited /ɣ/ occur in the later language, the attested forms speak to /g/ here. We set up two entries: 1) **foirggell**, and 2) **forggall**. cf. [[fuigell]] **fuigell**.
