In Sg. the nominative singular is always *folad*, with genitive singular *folaid*, while in Ml. we find rather *folud* for the nominative singualr and variation *folaid* and *foluid* for the genitive singular. The nominative singular is not attested in Wb, but the extant forms are compatible with the situation in Sg., which suggests replacement of nominative by dative in Ml. We thus set up two entries: 1) **folad**, and 2) **folud**.
