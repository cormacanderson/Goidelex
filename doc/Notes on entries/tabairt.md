Verbal noun of [[do·beir]] **do·beir**. The most frequent nominative singular form in the glosses is actually *tabairt*. This is a case of the dative coming to be used for the nominative (GOI §256), while the earlier form is *tabart*, which is also found in both Wb. and Ml. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) **tabairt**, and 2) **tabart**.
