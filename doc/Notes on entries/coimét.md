Verbal noun of [[con·eim]] **con·eim** and [[con·oí]] **con·oí**. While this lemma sometimes has /mʹ/ in the later language, it is not found with *mm* in Old Irish, so rather /μʹ/ can be assumed. It is consistently spelled *coméit* in Wb., suggesting a slender *t*, but forms elsewhere clearly point to a broad final consonant. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) **coimét**, and 2) **coiméit**.
