The vast majority of spellings are ambiguous as to the quality of the n, but point towards broad *n*. However, the headword in DIL is rather *láine*, and CorPH has both *láine* and *lánae*. We can be relatively certain of forms with slender *n* from spellings such as dative singular *láini* (Fél. Ep. 15). We thus set up two variants: 1) **lánae**, and 2) **láine**.
