In the first syllable, we usually find *u* in Wb., while *o* occurs twice (Wb27a26, Wb31c6), the single form attested in Ml. also having *o* (Ml54a6). CorPH labels this noun as irregular (cf. GOI §294), and there are not so many forms from Old Irish, which are consistent with ī-stem flexion. We set a single entry: 1) **omalddóit**.
