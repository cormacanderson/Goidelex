Verbal noun of [[ad·gládathar]] **ad·gládathar**. Not infrequently, we find *cc* representing /g/ in the Würzburg glosses (e.g. [[bec]] *becc* 'small', [[frecor]] *freccor* 'answer', [[loc]] *locc* 'place'). However, sometimes it also stands for /k/, so we have to assess the evidence in each individual case to determine the phonology. For this word, we assume /g/.
