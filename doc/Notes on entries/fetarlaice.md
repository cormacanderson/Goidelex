Spelled sometimes with *cc* in Wb., but we presume rather /g/ here (see **acaldam**), which is more plausible considering that it is borrowed from the Latin *uetere lege*. While usually inflected as a feminine iā-stem, Kavanagh (2001) notes that it is sometimes inflected as a neuter io-stem by analogy with **nuḟíadnaise**.
