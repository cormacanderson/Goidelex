Verbal noun of [[fo·loing]] **fo·loing**. The form *folach* in Ml. (cf. *folog* Wb17b23 a prima manu) has a separate headword in CorPH, while Kavanagh (2001) considers this together with *fulaṅg*, which is the more frequent Old Irish form. We set up two separate entries: 1) **fulaṅg**, and 2) **folach**.
