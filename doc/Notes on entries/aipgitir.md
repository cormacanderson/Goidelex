The phonology of this word is not altogether clear. It is certain that *p* represents /bʹ/, given forms such as *abgitir* (Wb33c13) and *abbgitir* (Sg23b5). For the consonant following this, Modern Irish *aibítir* strongly suggests a spirant /ɣʹ/ rather than a stop /gʹ/, hence *g*. However, the initial consonant of the final syllable is spelled always *t*, never *tt*, in Old Irish, which makes /dʹ/ more likely than /tʹ/, in contrast to the modern language. This is tentatively assumed here, and finds support from Thurneysen (GOI §915), who considers that the pronunciation of the letters in isolation 'a-be-(ce)-de' may have had an influence on this word. This lemma is inflected as an i-stem, but is invariable in the singular (GOI §302), which means setting up two classes: 1) invariable **aipgitir** in the singular, and 2) an i-stem **aipgitir** for the plural.
