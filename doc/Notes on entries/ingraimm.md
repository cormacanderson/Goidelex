Verbal noun of [[in·greinn]] **in·greinn**. The second syllable is most often spelled *ai*, but sometimes *ei* or even *i* in Old Irish. The variant with *ei* in an unstressed syllable is unusual and we take it to be an orthographic variant of *i* (cf. [[immchist]] **immchist**), indicating a palatalised cluster *ngr*. This requires us to set up two entries: 1) **ingraimm**, and 2) **ingrimm**.
