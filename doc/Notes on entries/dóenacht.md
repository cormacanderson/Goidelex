Synchronically in Old Irish, there is a difference in the quality of the *n* in different corpora, it usually being slender in Wb., only sometimes broad, while it is always broad in Ml., in Fél., and in MT (cf. DIL, which suggests in origin two separate words here). We set up two separate entries: 1) **dóenacht**, with broad *n*, and 2) **doínecht** with slender *n*.
