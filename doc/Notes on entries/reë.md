While this is apparently originally neuter (DIL), it appears as a feminine ia-stem in Old Irish. The citation form is often found *ré* with reduced hiatus. We thus set up two separate entries: 1) **reë** with a full paradigm, and 2) **ré** in the nominative and vocative singular and all numbers of the genitive.
