The frequent spelling *cathir* in the glosses is ambiguous as to the quality of the *th*, although it suggests it is broad. However, there is a short dative singular form *caithir* (Wb13b1) which points to rather slender *th* (GOI ยง318). As forms with slender *th* and broad *th* are both found in the later language, we set up two entries here, with unclear distribution: 1) **cathair**, and 2) **caithir**.
