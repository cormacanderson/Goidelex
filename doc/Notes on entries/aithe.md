There is insufficient evidence to securely assign this lemma to an inflectional class. Thurneysen discusses it under neuter o-stems (GOI §725) but mentions its aberrant flexion. CorPH tentatively suggests an iā-stem, which is compatible with the extant forms, if we assume the accusative for the forms Thurneysen and DIL consider nominative.
