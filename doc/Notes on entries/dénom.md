Verbal noun of [[do·gní]] **do·gní**. Similarly to **demon**, this noun varies between *u* and *o*, with forms in *u* found in both Wb. and Ml. In Sg., and sometimes in Wb., we find rather *dénom*, and elsewhere there are also cases in *a*. We consider this to be orthographic variation and have a single entry: 1) **dénom**.
