Verbal noun of [[as·oirc]] **as·oirc**. There is a range of variation in this word and in others built upon the same root (e.g. [[orggon]] **orggon**, [[frithorggon]] **frithorggon**, [[timmorggon]] **timmorggon**). Most common is *o* in the second syllable, although Ml. has rather *a* for this word and *timmorggon* (never for *orggon* or *frithorggon*), and Wb. also has *a* in the current word. As to the third syllable, Ml. consistently has *u* in the nominative singular, while Wb. has *o*. As the attested forms show a slightly different behaviour, we treat them differently too. For this word, we set up two entries: 1) **esorggon**, and 2) **esarggun**. See also [[frithorggon]] **frithorggon**.
