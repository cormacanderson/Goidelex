Verbal noun of [[do·díuschi]] **do·díuschi**. In the glosses we find *sg* or *sch* in this word, variation which is likely to be merely orthographic. Later sources have rather *sc* and this is the headword in DIL. The first points to a spirant after the *s*, the second to a stop, which is the much more common combination in Old Irish. We set up two entries: 1) **toidisgud**, and 2) **toidisgud**.
