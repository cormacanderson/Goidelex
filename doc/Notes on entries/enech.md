# enech

A difficult lemma, found more often in the plural than the singular in Old Irish. The initial vowel fluctuates between *ai*, *e*, and *i* suggesting the 'ambiguous' vowel (GOI §80). Furthermore, while the *n* is more often slender (e.g. Ml100b2, Fél Prol 42) it is sometimes broad (e.g. Ml65b10, Fél Prol 118). We thus set up two entries: 1) **enech** with slender *n*, and 2) **ainach** with broad *n*.
