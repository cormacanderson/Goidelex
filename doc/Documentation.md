# Derivational families
## derivational_base
The lexeme considered the most basic, generally the shortest, was selected here.

## base_POS
A broad categorisation into major parts of speech. The following values were recognised:
- `noun`
- `verb`
- `adjective`
- `prefixed_adjective`: where adjectives can occur either prefixed to a noun or independently, they are classified rather as adjectives

# Lexemes
## derivation
Where lexemes are compounded of two different elements, both derivational bases are included, in order, separated by a semicolon.

## POS
The following categories were recognised:
- `noun`: The default or elsewhere category of noun, not falling into any of the other noun categories categories.
- `verbal_noun`: Non-finite nominal associated to a verb.
- `compound_noun` (2 instances): Conventionalised nominal expression containing two nouns. These have equal stress on both elements and are separated by a hyphen in the normalised orthography, with lenition of the second element.
- `prefixed_noun` (29 instances, with 14 adjectival prefixes): Conventionalised nominal expressions consisting of  adjectival prefix and noun. These expressions have equal stress on both elements and are separated by a hyphen in the normalised orthography, with lenition of the second element.
- `numeral_noun`(9 instances): A somewhat heterogenous class comprising several different subtypes that I have not distinguished. These include:
    -  Genuine numerals such as _cethorcho_ 'forty', _cét_ 'hundred', and _míle_ 'thousand'. These can be used substantively and inflect like nouns, unlike the lower numerals which behave like adjectival prefixes.
    -  Nouns for identifying a unit of a number of things: _déide_ 'two things', _tréide_ 'triad, three things', _cethardae_ 'tetrad'.
    -  Nouns for counting people: _óenur_ 'single individual', _diäs_ 'two people', and _triär_ 'three people'. The nouns _óenur_ and _triär_ are somewhat problematic. Thurneysen (GOI §388) sees them as being compounds of the numerals and _fer_ 'man' and this feels natural to an Irish speaker, but Pedersen considers it to be volksetymologisch (VGKSii 136) and sees them as being formed rather with the numerals and a suffix \*aro. On formal grounds, I am somewhat sceptical that these can be considered genuine compound nouns in Old Irish, despite occasional spellings such as óenḟer vel. sim. This being the case, there are no grounds to treat them differently to _diäs_.
- `proper_noun`(3 instances): Proper nouns.

# Flexemes and lexemes
## When do we distinguish lexemes?
- Different meaning
- Different part of speech

## When do we distinguish flexemes?
- Different orthography
- Different inflectional properties
